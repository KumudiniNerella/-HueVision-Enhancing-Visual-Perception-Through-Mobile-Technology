# HueVision-Enhancing-Visual-Perception-Through-Mobile-Technology

HueVision is a user-friendly mobile application designed to identify and announce colors from images in real time.

The user can either upload an image or take a photo using the app's camera. With just a simple tap on the image, the app tells you the name of the color and its exact RGB values.

This functionality is powered by a Flask backend, which processes the image and extracts the pixel color data. It then compares this to a curated dataset of colors to find the closest match.

What makes HueVision stand out is its versatility. It's an invaluable tool for graphic designers and artists who need precise color information, and itâ€™s especially empowering for individuals with visual impairments, helping them navigate and interact with their surroundings more effectively.

Along with a sleek modern interface, the app also includes speech output for audio feedback and a color history feature to keep track of previously identified colors making it practical, inclusive, and intuitive."
